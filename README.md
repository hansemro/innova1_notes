Innova Flex Notes
=================

This repo contains notes on Innova Flex smartNIC cards in an attempt to repurpose the FPGA as
a development platform or an accelerator. Nvidia/Mellanox Innova Flex features ConnectX-4 Lx NIC
with a Kintex Ultrascale FPGA. Depending on the part number (P/N), the board has either a XCKU040
or XCKU060 FPGA.

Currently this repo targets MNV101511A-BCAT (one with XCKU060) for now. Contributions for the same
or different variants are welcome.

For information on FPGA-development on Innova-2 Flex, I recommend checking out @mwrnd's notes at
